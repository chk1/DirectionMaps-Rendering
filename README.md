## Prototypes and testing

You will find some prototypes and testing code in `/testing` that shows how you can render data from a PostGIS database.

You will need a running Postgres database with PostGIS and pgRouting installed and have some data imported.

OSM data extracts can be obtained from [bbbike](http://download.bbbike.org/osm/extract/).

A nice tutorial on how to install pgRouting and prepare the data for import can be found on the [ZevRoss blog](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/06/18/first-taste-of-routing-in-postgis-using-pgrouting/).
